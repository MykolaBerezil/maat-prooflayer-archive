# MEP-0001: Research Extensions for MA'AT ProofLayer

**Status:** Research & Discussion  
**Type:** Non-Breaking Additions  
**Compatibility:** MA'AT v1.0+  
**License:** Code under PolyForm Noncommercial 1.0.0; docs under CC BY-NC 4.0

## Overview

These extensions are optional modules that extend, not modify, the MA'AT core:

1. **Hyperbolic Geometry** - Hierarchical causal DAG embeddings using Poincaré ball model
2. **Fourth Gate: Decidability Analysis** - Computational complexity and undecidability detection
3. **Multi-Scale Pattern Detection** - Wavelet-based analysis across temporal scales
4. **Cross-Domain Translation Framework** - Hypothesis translation preserving semantic content
5. **System Health Monitoring** - Diversity metrics and degradation pattern detection

## Principles

- **Opt-in activation** via config/CLI
- **Interface preservation** - existing MA'AT APIs unchanged
- **Receipts augmented** (never rewritten) - backward compatible
- **Zero overhead when disabled** - no performance impact
- **Deterministic baselines** - reproducible, testable implementations

---

## Detailed Proposals

### 1. Hyperbolic Geometry Module (`maat/extensions/hyperbolic.py`)

**Motivation:** The causal DAG currently uses Euclidean space, which becomes inefficient when representing hierarchical hypothesis spaces where possibilities grow exponentially with depth. Many real-world causal structures are naturally hierarchical.

**Implementation:**
```python
class HyperbolicCausalDAG:
    """
    Extension of CausalDAG using Poincaré ball model.
    Maintains compatibility with base CausalDAG interface.
    """
    def embed_in_poincare(self, node: str) -> Vec:
        """Map nodes to hyperbolic space for better hierarchy representation"""
        
    def hyperbolic_distance(self, node1: str, node2: str) -> float:
        """Compute distance in hyperbolic space for causal strength"""
```

**Benefits:**
- Natural representation of tree-like causal structures
- Exponentially more efficient embedding of hierarchical relationships
- Better preservation of semantic distances in high-dimensional spaces
- Proven advantages in knowledge graph representation

**Integration Point:** Optional replacement for CausalDAG in `maat/engine/causal.py`

---

### 2. Fourth Gate: Decidability Analysis (`maat/slot/decidability_gate.py`)

**Motivation:** Some hypotheses are fundamentally unprovable within a given formal system. Detecting these prevents wasted computation and enables explicit handling of irreducible uncertainties.

**Implementation:**
```python
class DecidabilityGate:
    """
    Fourth gate for detecting undecidable propositions.
    Based on computational complexity theory and formal logic.
    """
    def test(self, hypothesis: Dict, evidence: List[Dict]) -> Dict:
        """
        Returns:
            - decidable: bool (whether hypothesis is decidable)
            - complexity_class: str (P, NP, EXPTIME, UNDECIDABLE)
            - confidence: float (confidence in classification)
            - reason: str (explanation if undecidable)
        """
```

**Benefits:**
- Prevents infinite loops on unprovable hypotheses
- Enables resource allocation based on computational complexity
- Provides formal guarantees about what can/cannot be proven
- Critical for AGI safety (knowing what you cannot know)

**Integration Point:** Add to `SlotGates.evaluate()` as optional fourth criterion

---

### 3. Multi-Scale Pattern Detection (`maat/mathx/multiscale.py`)

**Motivation:** Current FFT coherence operates at a single scale. Complex systems often exhibit patterns across multiple temporal and spatial scales simultaneously.

**Implementation:**
```python
class MultiScaleAnalyzer:
    """
    Wavelet-based multi-scale pattern detection.
    Extends FFT with scale-space analysis.
    """
    def wavelet_coherence(self, series: List[float]) -> Dict:
        """Compute coherence across multiple scales using wavelet transform"""
        
    def detect_scale_invariant_patterns(self, series: List[float]) -> List[Dict]:
        """Identify patterns that persist across scales (fractals, power laws)"""
```

**Benefits:**
- Captures patterns missed by single-scale FFT
- Detects fractal and self-similar structures common in complex systems
- Provides richer signal for hypothesis evaluation
- Aligns with neuroscience findings on multi-scale brain dynamics

**Integration Point:** Optional enhancement to `maat/mathx/coherence.py`

---

### 4. Cross-Domain Translation Framework (`maat/engine/translation.py`)

**Motivation:** Hypotheses arrive in various forms (numerical, logical, linguistic). A formal translation framework ensures all hypotheses can be tested uniformly.

**Implementation:**
```python
class DomainTranslator:
    """
    Category-theoretic framework for hypothesis translation.
    Preserves semantic content across representations.
    """
    DOMAINS = ['numeric', 'boolean', 'linguistic', 'temporal', 
               'causal', 'spatial', 'probabilistic', 'logical']
    
    def translate(self, hypothesis: Dict, source_domain: str, 
                  target_domain: str) -> Dict:
        """Apply functorial mapping between domains"""
        
    def verify_translation_fidelity(self, original: Dict, 
                                   translated: Dict) -> float:
        """Quantify semantic preservation in translation"""
```

**Benefits:**
- Enables unified testing of heterogeneous hypotheses
- Reduces information loss in domain conversion
- Facilitates integration with diverse AI systems
- Provides mathematical guarantees on translation quality

**Integration Point:** Preprocessor for HypothesisGenerator classes

---

### 5. System Health Monitoring (`maat/reactor/health.py`)

**Motivation:** High-level metrics (acceptance rate, regret) may hide systemic issues. Deep health monitoring ensures genuine learning vs metric optimization.

**Implementation:**
```python
class SystemHealthMonitor:
    """
    Comprehensive health tracking for MA'AT runtime.
    Detects pathological behaviors and degradation patterns.
    """
    def compute_diversity_metrics(self, receipts: List[Dict]) -> Dict:
        """Track hypothesis diversity, semantic coverage, exploration breadth"""
        
    def detect_degradation_patterns(self, history: List[Dict]) -> List[str]:
        """Identify concerning trends: semantic collapse, fixation, cherry-picking"""
        
    def compute_genuine_learning_rate(self, receipts: List[Dict]) -> float:
        """Distinguish genuine knowledge acquisition from metric gaming"""
```

**Benefits:**
- Early warning system for system degradation
- Ensures long-term stability and growth
- Provides interpretable health metrics for operators
- Critical for production deployments

**Integration Point:** Additional observer in RecursiveReactor

## Backward Compatibility Guarantees

All extensions follow these principles:

1. **Opt-in activation** via configuration (default: OFF)
2. **Interface preservation** with existing MA'AT APIs
3. **Receipt augmentation** (only add fields, never modify)
4. **Graceful degradation** when extensions unavailable
5. **Deterministic behavior** for reproducibility

## Open Research Questions

1. **Hyperbolic Geometry:** What is the optimal curvature for different hypothesis spaces?
2. **Decidability:** What percentage of real-world hypotheses are formally undecidable?
3. **Multi-Scale:** Which wavelet families best capture AI reasoning patterns?
4. **Translation:** Can we prove semantic preservation across all domain pairs?
5. **Health Monitoring:** What early indicators best predict system degradation?

## Benchmarks & Evaluation

Proposed benchmark framework:

```python
class ExtensionBenchmarks:
    def measure_improvement(self, extension: str, dataset: str) -> Dict:
        """

        - Hypothesis quality (precision/recall)
        - Computational efficiency
        - Degradation resistance
        - Long-term stability
        """
        
    def ablation_study(self, extensions: List[str]) -> Dict:
        """Test all combinations to identify synergies and conflicts"""
